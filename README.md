# SlackUser
Write a SlackUser class to represent a user of the Slack messaging platform. A SlackUser has a fullName, displayName, and list of teamMembers (represented by an ArrayList<SlackUser>).

Write the Java class declaration and private instance variables needed to represent a SlackUser.
Write a constructor to initialize a SlackUser with a specified full name and display name (passed as parameters). It should also instantiate the list of team members as an empty list.
Write getters and setters for the full name and display name instance variables.
Write a public method named, addTeamMember, that adds a given SlackUser to the user's list of team members.
Add a main method to the bottom of your class. Do the following in your main method.
Use the SlackUser constructor to instantiate a SlackUser object that represents your own user account (e.g. use your full name and display name).
Use the SlackUser constructor to instantiate a second SlackUser object that represents a user account with full name "Linus Torvalds" and display name "ThePenguin".
Use the addTeamMember method to add Linus Torvald's SlackUser object to your SlackUser object's list of team mates.
Provide javadocs for your class, the constructor, and each of the public methods.
